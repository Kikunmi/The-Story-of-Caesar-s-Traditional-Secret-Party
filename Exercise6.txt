# Exercise ðŸ“‹

Start with this initial guest directory:

```jsx
const guests = {
  ANTONY: {
    title: "General",
    region: "Rome",
    dietaryPreference: "Vegetarian",
    pastGifts: ["Golden Laurel", "Chariot"]
  },
  CICERO: {
    title: "Orator",
    region: "Arpinum",
    dietaryPreference: "Omnivore",
    pastGifts: ["Scroll of Proverbs", "Quill"]
  }
};

```

Follow the steps below and write your answers. Remember to place your responses as comments where they appear in the exercise.

## Step 1 ðŸ§©

Add "BRUTUS" to the guest directory. He's a "Senator" from "Rome", prefers "Vegan" food, and in the past, he has gifted Caesar a "Silver Dagger" and a "Marble Bust".

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```jsx
guests.BRUTUS = {
  title: "Senator",
  region: "Rome",
  dietaryPreference: "Vegan",
  pastGifts: ["Silver Dagger", "Marble Bust"]
};

```

## Step 2 ðŸ§©

Update CICERO's past gifts to include a "Golden Lyre".

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```jsx
guests.CICERO.pastGifts.push("Golden Lyre");

```

## Step 3 ðŸ§©

Retrieve the region of "ANTONY".

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```jsx
const antonyRegion = guests.ANTONY.region;
```

## Step 4 ðŸ§©

Due to unforeseen political events, "CICERO" needs to be discreetly removed from the guest list.

### Hint ðŸ’¡

- Use the `delete` keyword to remove properties from an object.

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```
delete guests.CICERO;
```

## Step 5 ðŸ§©

Assign ANTONY's profile to a new variable named `generalProfile`. Then, using this new variable, change the `region` of ANTONY to "Egypt".

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```jsx
const generalProfile = guests.ANTONY;
generalProfile.region = "Egypt";
```

## Question 1 ðŸ¤”

After executing Step 5, what will be the region of ANTONY in the original `guests` object?

### Answer ðŸ”‘

The region of ANTONY in the original `guests` object will be "Egypt". This is because objects in JavaScript are reference types. When we assign the object to a new variable, we're not creating a new copy of the object. Instead, both variables point to the same object in memory. Thus, changes made through one variable are reflected in the other.
