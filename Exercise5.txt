Caesar decides he wants the guest list in alphabetical order. Sort the array. However, Caesar wants his most honored guest (the one added first) to remain at the top of the list. Can you think of a way to sort the guests but keep the honored ones at the top?
Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
const honoredGuests = guests.slice(0, 1); // Extracts honored guests.
const otherGuests = guests.slice(1); // Extracts the rest of the guests.
otherGuests.sort(); // Sorts the other guests.
const sortedGuests = honoredGuests.concat(otherGuests); // Combines both arrays.
