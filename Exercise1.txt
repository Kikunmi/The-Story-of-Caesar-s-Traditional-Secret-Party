# Exercise ðŸ“‹

## Question 1 ðŸ¤”

Based on the story of Julius Caesar's secret party and the Caesar Cipher, identify potential variables you would need. Please ensure you use appropriate variable naming conventions in JavaScript.

### Answer ðŸ”‘

- `partyLocation`
- `shiftValue`
- `encryptedMessage`
- `decryptedMessage`
- `isPartySafe`

Note: You can give different names to the same variables and even introduce additional variables. This is just for fun and understanding the concepts.

## Question 2 ðŸ¤”

After identifying the variables from the story, specify their primitive data types in JavaScript. Also, provide these variables with some initial values.

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```
let partyLocation = "GARDEN"; // String
let shiftValue = 3; // Number
let encryptedMessage = ""; // String
let decryptedMessage = ""; // String
let isPartySafe = false; // Boolean

```

## Question 3 ðŸ¤”

From the variables you've identified, determine which ones should be declared using `const` and which ones should use `let`.

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```
let partyLocation = "GARDEN"; // As the message might change.
const shiftValue = 3; // Since the shift value remains constant throughout.
let encryptedMessage = ""; // This will change when we encode the message with the original party location.
let decryptedMessage = ""; // This will change when we decode the encrypted message to reveal the party location.
let isPartySafe = false; // Hopefully, this doesn't change.

```

## Question 4 ðŸ¤”

Given the variable `shiftValue`, write a piece of code to check if its value is an integer.

### Answer ðŸ”‘

```
const shiftValue = 3;
Number.isInteger(shiftValue);

```

The `Number.isInteger()` method determines whether the passed value is an integer. If `shiftValue` is an integer, it will return `true`; otherwise, it will return `false`.
