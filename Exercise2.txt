You are given the below code.
const friend = "BRUTUS"
const shiftValue = 3;

Please incorporate the following steps into a single JavaScript file, placing the provided code at the top. Insert your answers to the questions as comments where they appear.
Step 1 🧩​
Store the Latin alphabet in a variable with all letters in lowercase.
Answer 🔑​
const alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
​
Step 2 🧩​
Find the index of the first letter of Ceaser's friend. Store it in a variable.
Hints 💡​
Access the first letter of Ceaser's friend.
Ceaser's friend's is given in upper-case, but the alphabet was built in lower-case. Convert the case of the first letter.
Use a method on the alphabet to find indexes of given strings.
Answer 🔑​
const firstLetter = friend[0];
const index = alphabet.indexOf(firstLetter.toLowerCase());

​
Question 1 🤔​
Oh, I know B is the 2nd letter of the alphabet. Then, why the result is 1 instead of 2?
Answer 🔑​
JavaScript uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item of a string is accessed using 0.
Step 3 🧩​
Use the Caesar Cipher technique to shift the first letter of Caesar's friend by the given shift value, which is 3 positions. Find and store the encrypted letter in a variable.
Hints 💡​
Once you find the index of the letter, add the shift value to it to find the new index.
Answer 🔑​
const newIndex = index + shiftValue;
const encryptedFirstLetter = alphabet[newIndex];

​
Question 2 🤔​
If we continue shifting letters and go beyond the last letter, "z", which operator could help us to wrap around and continue from the beginning of the alphabet?
Answer 🔑​
The modulus operator, %, helps us wrap around the alphabet. If we try to access an index beyond the length of our alphabet, the modulus operator ensures that the result wraps around starting from 0. For instance, accessing the 28th position (which doesn't exist) would give us an index of 2, corresponding to the third letter, "c". This operator ensures we always get a valid index within the bounds of the alphabet.
Step 4 🧩​
Determine the length of the alphabet.
Hints 💡​
Use a specific property of strings in JavaScript to get their length.
Answer 🔑​
const alphabetLength = alphabet.length;

​
Step 5 🧩​
Use the Caesar Cipher technique to shift the first letter of Caesar's friend by the given shift value, ensuring the shift wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds.
Hints 💡​
Use the modulus operator to handle wrapping around the alphabet based on its length.
Answer 🔑​
const alphabetLength = alphabet.length;
const newIndex = (index + shiftValue) % alphabetLength;
const encryptedFirstLetter = alphabet[newIndex];

​
Step 6 🧩​
Caesar remembers that Brutus is particularly fond of challenges. Before sending the encrypted message, Caesar decides to send only a part of it as a teaser. Extract the first 3 characters from the encrypted message using the slice method. (Assume that the encrypted message is "EUXWXV".)
Hints 💡​
The slice method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string without modifying the original string.
It accepts two parameters: the starting index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive).
Answer 🔑​
const encryptedMessage = "EUXWXV";
const teaserMessage = encryptedMessage.slice(0, 3);
